TWISSJAVA: Twitter on Cassandra in Java.

Deps:
 + Maven: this will load our build deps.
   + Cassandra 0.6: the important thing.
   + Pelops: this is how we talk to the important thing.
   + Wicket: this is how we show other people the important thing.

Setup:
 + Install Cassandra 0.6 from http://cassandra.apache.org/ as well
    as its dependencies (Thrift). 
   + Copy the storage_conf.xml over the default configuration
 + check out twissjava

Run:
 + Start bin/cassandra
 + run `mvn jetty:run`
   + maven will download a ton of stuff.  this is normal.
   + NOTE: Jetty uses port 8080 by default, which is used for JMX
       for Cassandra. Start.java in this checkout has it changed to 8888.
 + browse to http://localhost:8888
